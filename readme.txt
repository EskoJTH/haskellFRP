Trying to figure out FRP in haskell. Most important used tools are Reactive-Banana and Reactive-Banana-SDL2 and SDL2. At the moment of writing WX appears to be brokent in latest version of GHC so that is one reason to use SDL instead. I have managed to get some FRP mixed with regular SDL2 so that the code compiles but the gui loop doesn't sustain itself for some reason yet. The program is supposed to display a blue window with a red square in it that turns blue while mouse click is detected on top of it and turns back red once button is raised.
